# Improving 90-Day User Retention at XYZ Fintech
### Data Analysis Case Study

This case study investigates why 20% of new users churn within the first 90 days of onboarding at a fintech application. The objective is to identify friction points in the user journey, validate them with data, and recommend actionable strategies to improve early retention.

## Objective
To diagnose where users drop off during onboarding, uncover behavioral drivers behind churn, and propose data-backed solutions that enhance activation and long-term engagement.

## Data and Methodology
A structured analysis was conducted using both quantitative and qualitative datasets.

### Quantitative Data
- User signup and profile information  
- Onboarding step completion  
- Session activity within the first 14 days  
- Feature usage patterns  
- Churn indicators  

### Qualitative Data
- Exit surveys  
- Customer support logs  
- Usability feedback  

### Tools Used
SQL, Excel, Power BI

These tools were applied to build funnels, analyze early engagement trends, and validate patterns observed in user behavior.

## Analysis Approach
1. Mapped the onboarding funnel (Signup → Step 1 → Step 2 → Activation → Churn).  
2. Identified high drop-off stages using funnel metrics.  
3. Analyzed engagement patterns to determine which actions correlate with successful onboarding.  
4. Reviewed qualitative feedback to understand motivational and usability challenges.  
5. Combined insights to form a comprehensive view of retention barriers.  
6. Collaborated with Product, UX, and Marketing stakeholders to validate findings.

## Findings
The analysis revealed that early churn is driven by onboarding friction, low feature discoverability, and limited personalized guidance. A significant number of users failed to complete activation steps during the first week, reducing the likelihood of long-term retention.

## Proposed Solutions
- Simplify onboarding and personalize the first-time experience based on user goals.  
- Implement nudges and reminders to encourage completion of key actions.  
- Introduce lightweight gamification to highlight progress and reinforce engagement.  
- Use A/B testing to validate improvements before scaling to all users.

## Measurement Plan
A weekly retention dashboard was designed to track:
- Activation rate  
- Day-7 and Day-30 retention  
- Funnel completion metrics  
- Nudge engagement and performance  

SQL-based extracts and Power BI visualizations support ongoing monitoring.

## Outcome
This case study outlines a clear, data-driven framework for improving early retention. It demonstrates the use of funnel analytics, user behavior analysis, qualitative insights, and experimentation planning to guide product decision-making in a fintech environment
